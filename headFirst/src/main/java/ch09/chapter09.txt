1)Increment a counter to track how many objects of this class type have been made.
Useful to assign a unique car number or ID, like "Car #3" out of all the racing cars.

2) Assign runtime-specific state (data about what’s happening NOW).
Set current fuel level, initial speed (0), tire temperature, or 
starting line position.

3) Assign values to the object’s important instance variables.
Essential for setting car model, color, driver name, or initial stats like 
horsepower or weight.

4) Get and save a reference to the object that’s creating the new object.
If a Team object or RaceManager is creating the car, 
the Car might need a reference to notify/report back to it.

5) Add the object to an ArrayList.
When creating a car, automatically add it to the ArrayList<Car> that tracks all cars 
in the race.

6) Create HAS-A objects.
If the car "has-a" Engine, Tire, or GPS, the constructor should create or receive 
those sub-objects.

7) Register the car with the game's event system.
So the car can receive game events like collisions, lap completions, or 
weather changes.
